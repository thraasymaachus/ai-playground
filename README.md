Code written by GPT-4, with some human guidance.

This is the result of messing around with GPT-4's code writing capabilities over several days. A lot of these programs would have taken me a whole lot of time to write myself.

The environment is what ChatGPT has access to (i.e cutoff at Sept 2021). The python version is 5.9.7.
