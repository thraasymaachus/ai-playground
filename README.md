Code written by GPT-4, with some human guidance. The original prompt is given in each project folder. I have omitted all of the back and forth between myself and the chatbot, which details things like which libraries to install, a whole lot of debugging, and improvements to the programs. Some results, such as code for hexahexaflexagon visualisations, and a platformer game do not function properly.

This is the result of messing around with GPT-4's code writing capabilities over several days. A lot of these programs would have taken me a whole lot of time to write myself. It's an excellent tool for teaching yourself new libraries. Many of the limitations it has now for writing code will soon be smoothed over.

The environment is what ChatGPT has access to (i.e cutoff at Sept 2021). The python version is 5.9.7.
