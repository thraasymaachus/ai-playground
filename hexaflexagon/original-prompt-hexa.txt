I think we should start from scratch. I want you to use python to animate a simple hexaflexagon, and a tuckerman traverse that corresponds to the hexaflexagon. Are you clear about what I'm after here? If not, feel free to ask some clarifying questions. Please do not reuse your code from above. Furthermore, you should assume I have the following libraries installed, and I'm using python 3.9.7. If you need to use more, you may, but please specify the version I should use.
